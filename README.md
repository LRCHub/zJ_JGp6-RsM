[00:02.74] Ballin' since I was jit
[00:04.68] Way before Oakland filmin' the skits
[00:06.50] I had a goal to get rich
[00:18.50] 
[00:08.28] Momma was strugglin' paying the rent
[00:10.18] I couldn't help her with shit
[00:12.05] Hate that I'm feelin' so stuck in this bitch (Devo this shit hard)
[00:13.64] Car broke down, can't fix that shit
[00:31.14]

[00:17.84] O2, old, I'll whip that bitch
[00:19.01] She left me 'lone but I miss that bitch
[00:20.89] If she text right now, I'll hit that bitch
[00:41.89] 
[00:23.05] Old friends like "How you get that lit?"
[00:24.72] Same old me but they think I switched
[00:43.22] 
[00:26.82] Fuck old friends, I don't know that bitch
[00:28.64] Racks too big, can't fold that shit
[00:30.48] I ain't get none when I owned that shit
[00:49.98] 
[00:33.65] Momma I told you we gon' be okay
[00:35.58] Whippin' that Benz and she live in L.A
[00:37.34] Tryna thank God but don't know what to say
[00:58.34] 
[00:38.94] Don't call that lil' ass place no estate
[00:40.99] Unless it came with a pool and a gate
[00:42.89] Check the rear before I pull in the gate
[00:44.75] All my watches flooded just like a lake
[01:04.25] 
[00:46.54] Lately I've been showing up extra late
[00:48.41] Rich nigga take her on a cheap date
[00:50.53] 4 for 4 Wendy's get her a plate
[00:52.16] Love when these nuts all up in her face
[01:11.66] 
[00:53.95] She say "Wow," never met a nigga with dick in her house
[00:56.75] Spit in her mouth
[00:57.90] Dickin' her out with the choppa in the couch for a rat or a mouse
[01:30.40] 
[01:00.36] Mm, I feel like Michael Jackson
[01:04.20] Moonwalkin' through the Calabasas
[01:05.59] Louis bag gotta hold the ratchet
[01:07.37] Just in case a nigga want some action
[01:25.87] 
[01:09.99] Mm, got some millions but it's just a fraction
[01:12.87] Spendin' money for my satisfaction
[01:14.72] Benjamin's, we don't fuck with Jackson's
[01:34.72] 
[01:15.62] Bet when I dropped, they don't post that shit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
